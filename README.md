# challenge-maximum-depth-of-binary-tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

<br />

Example 1:

![tmp-image](./tmp-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

<br />

Example 2:
```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```

<br />

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
